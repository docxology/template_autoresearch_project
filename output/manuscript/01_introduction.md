# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

## Bounded Research As Infrastructure {#sec:bounded-research-infrastructure}

AutoResearch systems are most useful when their planning, evidence, evaluation,
and review surfaces remain inspectable. The recent pattern popularized by
bounded coding-agent research loops is simple: define a tractable objective,
try candidate changes under a budget, keep the result that improves the metric,
and leave a replayable trace of what happened [@karpathy_autoresearch_2026].
That pattern is powerful, but it is also easy to overstate. A public research
template should show how to run the loop without hiding cost, evidence, review,
or execution boundaries.

## Exemplar Task {#sec:exemplar-task}

This project implements that safer version. The central task is
`small MNIST neural-network classification`: `MNIST handwritten digit database` from the handwritten-digit database
[@lecun_mnist_database], a `nearest-centroid` baseline, and a
finite list of candidate model families (`MLP, nearest-centroid, softmax regression, tiny patch-attention`). The
AutoResearch loop is responsible for proposing candidate configurations,
evaluating them against `test_accuracy`, selecting the best result with
deterministic tie-breaking, and writing the evidence needed to review the
claim.

## Contribution And Boundary {#sec:contribution-boundary}

The contribution is not a new `MNIST` classifier. It is a
template-level demonstration of how bounded AutoResearch can be orchestrated
through the same lifecycle used for reproducible papers: tests run first,
analysis writes structured artifacts, rendering hydrates manuscript variables,
validation checks evidence and readiness, and copy stages publish final
deliverables. The default path makes no network calls, no LLM calls, executes
no generated code, and never treats a generated review packet as human
approval. The methods in @sec:methodology define that boundary, and the results
in @sec:results report only what the validated artifacts support.

## Process Organization Motif {#sec:process-organization-motif}

The exemplar also treats research orchestration itself as a first-class
research object. In that limited operational sense, "research for research's
sake" means that programs, ledgers, evidence registries, validation gates, and
manuscript hydration do more than report a result: they maintain the conditions
under which the next research step can be inspected, replayed, criticized, and
extended. This is a process analogy, not a moral claim that software is an end
in itself or a biological claim that the template is alive.

## Related Work And Current Trends {#sec:related-work}

### Information Overload And Machine-Readable Science {#sec:information-overload-machine-readable-science}

The current AutoResearch literature is driven by a practical bottleneck:
scientific output is growing faster than document-centered review and synthesis
can absorb. Recent science-of-science evidence complicates any simple
productivity story: AI-augmented scientists can publish and be cited more often,
but the same adoption pattern can narrow the collective range of topics and
interactions in science [@hao_ai_tools_focus_2026]. This is a 2026 Nature result,
not a 2024 analysis, and it motivates governance rather than celebration.

One response is to make literature synthesis more source governed.
OpenScholar uses retrieval-augmented generation over a large scientific passage
store and reports citation accuracy improvements on literature synthesis tasks
[@asai_openscholar_2026]. PaperQA2 similarly evaluates literature-search agents
against expert scientific tasks and emphasizes cited answers, contradiction
detection, and factuality [@skarlinski_paperqa2_2024]. STORM, PaperQA, and GPT
Researcher are adjacent source-grounded writing systems that motivate this
project's insistence on citation-backed claims and visible evidence surfaces
[@shao_storm_2024; @lala_paperqa_2023; @gpt_researcher_2026]. The common lesson
is that automated writing is not enough: claims must remain tied to inspectable
sources, artifacts, and evaluation records.

### Structured Distillation And Conceptual Knowledge Substrates {#sec:structured-distillation-knowledge-substrates}

The Discovery Engine proposes a more structural answer to the same overload
problem. It distills publications into source-linked knowledge artifacts,
organizes those artifacts under a conceptual schema, encodes them into a
high-dimensional Conceptual Tensor, and unrolls that tensor into graph and
vector views for agent navigation [@baulin_discovery_engine_2025]. This project
does not construct a Conceptual Nexus Model or claim domain-scale literature
synthesis. It adopts a much smaller analogue: outputs, ledgers, evidence
registries, figure records, and hydrated manuscript variables are file-backed
objects whose provenance can be checked before publication.

The representational background is broader than one framework. FAIR principles
argue for data that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by
people and machines [@wilkinson2016fair]. RO-Crate and Workflow Run RO-Crate
package research artifacts and computational executions with linked-data
metadata [@soiland_reyes2022rocrate; @soiland_reyes2024workflow_run_rocrate].
Hyperdimensional computing and vector symbolic architectures provide one route
for robust high-dimensional symbolic-subsymbolic representations
[@heddes_hdc_2024], while tensor factorization methods such as TuckER and
mixed-geometry tensor factorization show how multi-relational knowledge graphs
can be completed and queried as structured tensors
[@balazevic_tucker_2019; @yusupov_mixed_geometry_2025]. The local contribution
here is not a new knowledge representation method; it is an executable template
that makes a small research workflow compatible with that machine-readable
direction.

### End-To-End AutoResearch Systems {#sec:end-to-end-autoresearch-systems}

The most ambitious AutoResearch systems now aim at the entire scientific
lifecycle. The AI Scientist assembles idea generation, experiment execution,
paper writing, and automated review [@lu_aiscientist_2024], and its Nature
version reports an end-to-end AI research pipeline whose generated manuscript
passed a workshop peer-review round [@lu_ai_scientist_nature_2026].
AI Scientist-v2 removes more hand-authored scaffolding and uses agentic tree
search for broader hypothesis exploration [@yamada_ai_scientist_v2_2025].
FutureHouse's platform exposes specialized scientific agents for literature
search, deep review, novelty checking, and chemistry planning
[@futurehouse_platform_2025], while Robin integrates literature and data-analysis
agents in a lab-in-the-loop discovery workflow [@ghareeb_robin_2026].

Survey work is already separating reliable assistance from risky autonomy.
The AI for Auto-Research roadmap describes the full lifecycle from creation to
dissemination, but stresses that novelty, research-level implementation, and
judgment remain fragile under automation [@kong_ai_auto_research_2026].
EXHYTE frames discovery as an iterative Exploration, Hypothesis generation, and
Testing loop, clarifying where current systems are mature and where closed-loop
autonomy remains thin [@hasib_exhyte_2025]. This exemplar therefore takes the
opposite stance from full autonomy: it implements a bounded local loop whose
candidate space, data, cost, outputs, and review gates can be audited.

### Autoformalization And Verification {#sec:autoformalization-verification}

Autoformalization supplies a different kind of boundary: instead of only asking
whether generated text is plausible, it asks whether an informal statement can
be translated into a form that a proof assistant or compiler can check.
AlphaProof shows the power of reinforcement learning over formal mathematical
proof search [@hubert_alphaproof_2025]. Process-driven autoformalization in
Lean uses compiler feedback as a precise signal for improving translations
from natural-language mathematics to formal statements and proofs
[@lu_process_driven_autoformalization_2024]. APOLLO turns Lean feedback into an
iterative proof-repair workflow in which generated proofs are decomposed,
patched, and reverified [@apollo_lean_collaboration_2025].

This project does not perform theorem proving, proof repair, or formal
mathematical verification. It borrows the architectural lesson: generated
research artifacts should be checked by deterministic tools with explicit error
surfaces. Here those tools are test suites, schema checks, evidence registries,
render validation, source hygiene greps, and review packets rather than Lean,
Isabelle, or Coq.

### ML For ML And Evolutionary Algorithm Discovery {#sec:ml-for-ml-evolutionary-discovery}

ML-for-ML systems optimize models, code, or algorithms with search loops that are
themselves subject to evaluation. Karpathy's `autoresearch` repository frames a
minimal version of this pattern as a prompt-controlled system with a fixed
budget, editable code surface, and comparable metric
[@karpathy_autoresearch_2026]. MLAgentBench and MLE-bench package machine
learning tasks as scored, replayable environments with logs and grading outputs
[@huang_mlagentbench_2023; @chan_mle_bench_2024].

At a larger scale, AlphaEvolve couples language-model proposals to evolutionary
program search and automated evaluators, producing algorithmic improvements in
mathematics and computing [@romera_paredes_alphaevolve_2025]. DeepEvolve adds
external retrieval, multi-file code editing, and debugging to the same basic
proposal-implementation-evaluation loop [@deepevolve_2025]. This manuscript's
candidate search is intentionally smaller: a finite list of configured model
families is evaluated against `test_accuracy`, with deterministic selection
and recorded deferrals rather than unbounded code mutation.

### Agentic Science, Graph Retrieval, And Epistemic Foraging {#sec:agentic-science-graph-retrieval}

Agentic science surveys describe systems that move from tool use toward
scientific agency across perception, knowledge representation, planning,
experimentation, analysis, and communication [@wei_agentic_science_2025;
@gridach_agentic_science_2025]. GraphRAG work adds structured retrieval to that
picture: graph construction and graph-aware retrieval can support multi-hop
reasoning, but benchmarks also show that knowledge-graph RAG remains brittle
when relevant knowledge is incomplete [@graphrag_bench_2026;
@brink_kg_rag_2026]. Active-inference perspectives make a similar design demand
in different language: scientific agents need persistent uncertainty-aware
memory, causal models, counterfactual exploration, deterministic validation, and
human judgment as an architectural component [@active_inference_science_2025].

This exemplar uses those ideas as constraints, not as capabilities it already
possesses. It does not run live literature mining, autonomous proof search,
external agent swarms, graph-based hypothesis hunting, or self-approval.
Instead it exposes bounded candidates, explicit budgets, local evidence links,
local `MNIST` input data, benchmark-style scoring, source-linked
figures, manuscript hydration, and human review gates. That is the intended
safe baseline for a public template.

### Benchmark, Documentation, And Process Analogies {#sec:benchmark-documentation-process-analogies}

`MNIST` and LeNet remain useful here because they provide a
compact historical benchmark for small neural networks and handwriting
recognition [@lecun_gradient_1998; @lecun_mnist_database]. Vision Transformers
introduce the patch-token pattern for image classification at scale
[@dosovitskiy_vit_2020]; this exemplar borrows only the patching and attention
representation through `Tiny patch-attention classifier`, then keeps the
implementation inside the configured candidate budget. MLPerf Tiny and OpenML
motivate explicit task descriptions, fixed inputs, machine-readable run
metadata, and checkable metrics [@banbury_mlperf_tiny_2021;
@vanschoren_openml_2014]. Machine-learning reproducibility checklists motivate
reporting data, seeds, model sizes, hyperparameters, and compute boundaries
[@pineau_reproducibility_2020].

Dataset and model documentation work further informs the safe boundary.
Datasheets for Datasets motivate explicit reporting of dataset motivation,
composition, collection, and recommended use [@gebru2021datasheets]. Model Cards
motivate structured reporting of model context, intended use, evaluation
procedure, and limitations [@mitchell2019model_cards]. The diagnostic layer
follows the same conservative reporting posture: calibration is treated as
separate from accuracy [@guo2017calibration], binomial accuracy intervals use
Wilson-style score intervals [@wilson1927probable_inference], matched classifier
comparison is summarized through paired discordance
[@dietterich1998statistical_tests], deterministic bootstrap intervals are local
resampling diagnostics [@efron1993bootstrap], and probability quality is
reported with Brier score, negative log likelihood, and chance-corrected
agreement [@brier1950verification; @cohen1960coefficient].

The process language is borrowed cautiously from teleology and theoretical
biology. Kant's account of organized beings treats a natural purpose as a whole
whose parts and whole mutually condition one another
[@ginsborg_kant_aesthetics_teleology]. Autopoiesis characterizes living systems
through self-producing organization [@varela_autopoiesis_1974], and later work
connects Kantian natural purpose to autopoietic individuality
[@weber_varela_life_after_kant_2002]. Moreno and Mossio's account of biological
autonomy emphasizes organizational closure and self-maintenance
[@moreno_mossio_biological_autonomy_2015]. This paper uses those ideas only as
disciplined analogies for configured scientific workflows whose artifacts help
reproduce, constrain, and evaluate subsequent artifacts.

Security and supply-chain references enter with the same restraint. NIST's
zero-trust architecture treats verification as explicit and continuous rather
than inherited from a trusted perimeter [@nist_sp800_207_zero_trust]. The NIST
Secure Software Development Framework emphasizes repeatable practices for
reducing software vulnerability risk [@nist_sp800_218_ssdf]. SLSA frames
software-artifact provenance and supply-chain integrity as a graded assurance
problem [@slsa_spec_latest], while MITRE ATT&CK T1195 names supply-chain
compromise as a concrete adversary technique [@mitre_attack_t1195]. This
exemplar borrows those frameworks as disciplined analogies for local research
artifact integrity: checksums, inventories, review gates, and explicit
non-claims, not production deployment certification.

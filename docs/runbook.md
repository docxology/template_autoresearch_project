# Runbook

Run the full deterministic AutoResearch exemplar through the main template
orchestrator:

```bash
./run.sh --pipeline --project template_autoresearch_project --core-only --skip-infra
```

The command executes the standard project stages:

1. Project tests validate config parsing, deterministic ML-task behavior, loop
   generation, manuscript variable hydration, and thin scripts.
2. Project analysis runs `scripts/run_autoresearch_loop.py` and
   `scripts/z_generate_manuscript_variables.py`.
3. Rendering consumes generated manuscript variables and resolved manuscript
   files.
4. Output validation includes AutoResearch readiness because
   `autoresearch.yaml` is present.
5. Copy outputs moves final deliverables into the repository-level `output/`
   tree.

## Loop sequence (`src.loop.run_autoresearch_loop`)

1. Compose plan via `build_autoresearch_plan()` and merge manuscript settings
   via `build_loop_config()`.
2. Run intrinsic readiness checks (domain profile, experiment plan, pipeline
   contracts, thin orchestrators).
3. Write core artifacts (plan JSON, loop markdown, stage matrix CSV, figure).
4. Write the first evidence registry snapshot from on-disk artifacts.
5. Run the bounded local MNIST neural-network task and write resolved config,
   results, candidate ledger, confusion matrix, training history, error
   examples, probability records, classification diagnostics, calibration
   report, calibration-bin intervals, candidate accuracy intervals,
   class-balance counts, robustness report, probability diagnostics, bootstrap
   intervals, paired baseline comparison, statistical summary, training
   diagnostics, candidate rank-stability diagnostics, report, benchmark score,
   candidate-selection audit, diagnostic-boundary report, candidate-score
   figure, rank-stability figure, and figure-quality report.
6. Build file-backed claims and finalize loop JSON, review packet, summary, and
   manuscript variables.
7. Write method-contract artifacts: research program, idea ledger, run ledger,
   deferred review decisions, benchmark grading report, and benchmark scores.
8. Refresh loop payloads provisionally (`readiness_valid=False`) and write the
   first local security artifacts, schema manifest, local research-object
   manifest, phase ledger, and artifact manifest.
9. Run extrinsic readiness checks (evidence registry, artifact manifest,
   required artifacts, method ledgers, review gates, benchmark outputs, and
   enabled security artifacts).
10. Write the combined intrinsic + extrinsic readiness report.
11. Rebuild claims after readiness reports exist and refresh loop payloads with
   final `readiness_valid` and output paths.
12. Regenerate final figures and figure registry captions from the final loop
   state, including candidate scores, confusion matrix, per-class accuracy,
   learning curves, complexity/accuracy, error examples, calibration,
   classification metrics, confusion pairs, generalization gaps, robustness
   matrix, probability and margin distributions, bootstrap intervals, paired
   correctness, selective accuracy, probability quality, training dynamics,
   candidate rank stability, candidate lifecycle, local class balance, local
   data contact sheet, readiness matrix, closure flow, security-control matrix,
   and integrity chain.
13. Write manuscript variables, registry-backed figure blocks, and variable
   provenance sidecars.
14. Rewrite the compact evidence-registry report, security artifacts, phase
   ledger, schema manifest, local research-object manifest, figure-quality
   report, and artifact manifest.

The evidence registry is validated in memory. By default,
`output/reports/evidence_registry.json` is a compact reviewer-facing summary
with counts and a bounded fact sample. To debug individual registry facts
locally, run the loop with `TEMPLATE_EVIDENCE_REGISTRY_FULL=1`; this additionally
writes `output/reports/evidence_registry_full.json`, which is not part of the
required artifact contract.

Targeted checks:

```bash
uv run python scripts/pipeline/stage_01_test.py --project template_autoresearch_project --project-only --quiet
uv run python scripts/pipeline/stage_02_analysis.py --project template_autoresearch_project
uv run python -m infrastructure.autoresearch.cli plan --project template_autoresearch_project
uv run python -m infrastructure.autoresearch.cli benchmark --project template_autoresearch_project
uv run python -m infrastructure.autoresearch.cli validate --project template_autoresearch_project --fail-on-issues
```

Review `output/reports/autoresearch_review_packet.md` before treating the
generated outputs as publication-ready. The exemplar records review readiness;
it does not approve itself.
Also review `output/reports/autoresearch_security_review.md`; it is local
artifact-integrity evidence, not an external security certification.
Use `output/data/autoresearch_schema_manifest.json` to confirm schema-versioned
JSON governance payloads and `output/data/research_object_manifest.json` to
review the local package of observed paths and checksums.

## Fixture maintenance

The default pipeline uses the checked-in `data/mnist_small.npz` fixture and does
not download MNIST. To intentionally rebuild that fixture, run the manual
maintenance utility:

```bash
uv run python projects/templates/template_autoresearch_project/scripts/regenerate_mnist_fixture.py
```

Do not wire this script into project tests, analysis, rendering, validation, or
CI. The maintenance path verifies the fixed HTTPS source URL, file sizes, and
SHA-256 hashes before rewriting the fixture and provenance files.

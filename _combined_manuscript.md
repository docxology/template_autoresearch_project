# Abstract {#sec:abstract}

This paper presents `Deterministic bounded AutoResearch for a small MNIST neural-network task`, a public template exemplar that
turns an AutoResearch loop into ordinary reproducible research infrastructure.
The case study is intentionally small but concrete: `2000` training
and `500` test images from `MNIST handwritten digit database` are evaluated by the
bounded `small MNIST neural-network classification` loop. The run evaluates
`4` of `5` proposed candidates,
including `Tiny patch-attention classifier`, selects
`exp-mlp-tanh-64` (`MLP`,
`50890` parameters), and improves `test_accuracy` from
`82.6%` to `89.4%`
(`6.8%` absolute change). The validated diagnostic layer reports
macro F1 `89.4%`, bootstrap accuracy interval
`86.4% to 92.0%`, Brier score `0.161`,
negative log likelihood `0.361`, top-2 accuracy
`95.6%`, and exact McNemar p-value `0.000`.
The same pipeline writes proposal, candidate, run, review, benchmark, evidence,
figure, confusion-matrix, statistical-summary, probability-quality, and
security-integrity artifacts from declared output contracts; uses
`0` LLM calls at USD `0.00` cost; and records
`7` configured stages, `6` supported
local-artifact claims, and `78` required artifacts.
The local security attestation status is `passed`,
with `0` checksum mismatch(es). The final
readiness status is `passed`, with review gates deferred to a
human rather than self-approved by the generated run.

# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

## Bounded Research As Infrastructure {#sec:bounded-research-infrastructure}

AutoResearch systems are most useful when their planning, evidence, evaluation,
and review surfaces remain inspectable. The recent pattern popularized by
bounded coding-agent research loops is simple: define a tractable objective,
try candidate changes under a budget, keep the result that improves the metric,
and leave a replayable trace of what happened [karpathy_autoresearch_2026].
That pattern is powerful, but it is also easy to overstate. A public research
template should show how to run the loop without hiding cost, evidence, review,
or execution boundaries.

## Exemplar Task {#sec:exemplar-task}

This project implements that safer version. The central task is
`small MNIST neural-network classification`: `MNIST handwritten digit database` from the handwritten-digit database
[lecun_mnist_database], a `nearest-centroid` baseline, and a
finite list of candidate model families (`MLP, nearest-centroid, softmax regression, tiny patch-attention`). The
AutoResearch loop is responsible for proposing candidate configurations,
evaluating them against `test_accuracy`, selecting the best result with
deterministic tie-breaking, and writing the evidence needed to review the
claim.

## Contribution And Boundary {#sec:contribution-boundary}

The contribution is not a new `MNIST` classifier. It is a
template-level demonstration of how bounded AutoResearch can be orchestrated
through the same lifecycle used for reproducible papers: tests run first,
analysis writes structured artifacts, rendering hydrates manuscript variables,
validation checks evidence and readiness, and copy stages publish final
deliverables. The default path makes no network calls, no LLM calls, executes
no generated code, and never treats a generated review packet as human
approval. The methods in @sec:methodology define that boundary, and the results
in @sec:results report only what the validated artifacts support.

## Process Organization Motif {#sec:process-organization-motif}

The exemplar also treats research orchestration itself as a first-class
research object. In that limited operational sense, "research for research's
sake" means that programs, ledgers, evidence registries, validation gates, and
manuscript hydration do more than report a result: they maintain the conditions
under which the next research step can be inspected, replayed, criticized, and
extended. This is a process analogy, not a moral claim that software is an end
in itself or a biological claim that the template is alive.

## Related Work And Current Trends {#sec:related-work}

### Information Overload And Machine-Readable Science {#sec:information-overload-machine-readable-science}

The current AutoResearch literature is driven by a practical bottleneck:
scientific output is growing faster than document-centered review and synthesis
can absorb. Recent science-of-science evidence complicates any simple
productivity story: AI-augmented scientists can publish and be cited more often,
but the same adoption pattern can narrow the collective range of topics and
interactions in science [hao_ai_tools_focus_2026]. This is a 2026 Nature result,
not a 2024 analysis, and it motivates governance rather than celebration.

One response is to make literature synthesis more source governed.
OpenScholar uses retrieval-augmented generation over a large scientific passage
store and reports citation accuracy improvements on literature synthesis tasks
[asai_openscholar_2026]. PaperQA2 similarly evaluates literature-search agents
against expert scientific tasks and emphasizes cited answers, contradiction
detection, and factuality [skarlinski_paperqa2_2024]. STORM, PaperQA, and GPT
Researcher are adjacent source-grounded writing systems that motivate this
project's insistence on citation-backed claims and visible evidence surfaces
[shao_storm_2024; lala_paperqa_2023; gpt_researcher_2026]. The common lesson
is that automated writing is not enough: claims must remain tied to inspectable
sources, artifacts, and evaluation records.

### Structured Distillation And Conceptual Knowledge Substrates {#sec:structured-distillation-knowledge-substrates}

The Discovery Engine proposes a more structural answer to the same overload
problem. It distills publications into source-linked knowledge artifacts,
organizes those artifacts under a conceptual schema, encodes them into a
high-dimensional Conceptual Tensor, and unrolls that tensor into graph and
vector views for agent navigation [baulin_discovery_engine_2025]. This project
does not construct a Conceptual Nexus Model or claim domain-scale literature
synthesis. It adopts a much smaller analogue: outputs, ledgers, evidence
registries, figure records, and hydrated manuscript variables are file-backed
objects whose provenance can be checked before publication.

The representational background is broader than one framework. FAIR principles
argue for data that are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable by
people and machines [wilkinson2016fair]. RO-Crate and Workflow Run RO-Crate
package research artifacts and computational executions with linked-data
metadata [soiland_reyes2022rocrate; soiland_reyes2024workflow_run_rocrate].
Hyperdimensional computing and vector symbolic architectures provide one route
for robust high-dimensional symbolic-subsymbolic representations
[heddes_hdc_2024], while tensor factorization methods such as TuckER and
mixed-geometry tensor factorization show how multi-relational knowledge graphs
can be completed and queried as structured tensors
[balazevic_tucker_2019; yusupov_mixed_geometry_2025]. The local contribution
here is not a new knowledge representation method; it is an executable template
that makes a small research workflow compatible with that machine-readable
direction.

### End-To-End AutoResearch Systems {#sec:end-to-end-autoresearch-systems}

The most ambitious AutoResearch systems now aim at the entire scientific
lifecycle. The AI Scientist assembles idea generation, experiment execution,
paper writing, and automated review [lu_aiscientist_2024], and its Nature
version reports an end-to-end AI research pipeline whose generated manuscript
passed a workshop peer-review round [lu_ai_scientist_nature_2026].
AI Scientist-v2 removes more hand-authored scaffolding and uses agentic tree
search for broader hypothesis exploration [yamada_ai_scientist_v2_2025].
FutureHouse's platform exposes specialized scientific agents for literature
search, deep review, novelty checking, and chemistry planning
[futurehouse_platform_2025], while Robin integrates literature and data-analysis
agents in a lab-in-the-loop discovery workflow [ghareeb_robin_2026].

Survey work is already separating reliable assistance from risky autonomy.
The AI for Auto-Research roadmap describes the full lifecycle from creation to
dissemination, but stresses that novelty, research-level implementation, and
judgment remain fragile under automation [kong_ai_auto_research_2026].
EXHYTE frames discovery as an iterative Exploration, Hypothesis generation, and
Testing loop, clarifying where current systems are mature and where closed-loop
autonomy remains thin [hasib_exhyte_2025]. This exemplar therefore takes the
opposite stance from full autonomy: it implements a bounded local loop whose
candidate space, data, cost, outputs, and review gates can be audited.

### Autoformalization And Verification {#sec:autoformalization-verification}

Autoformalization supplies a different kind of boundary: instead of only asking
whether generated text is plausible, it asks whether an informal statement can
be translated into a form that a proof assistant or compiler can check.
AlphaProof shows the power of reinforcement learning over formal mathematical
proof search [hubert_alphaproof_2025]. Process-driven autoformalization in
Lean uses compiler feedback as a precise signal for improving translations
from natural-language mathematics to formal statements and proofs
[lu_process_driven_autoformalization_2024]. APOLLO turns Lean feedback into an
iterative proof-repair workflow in which generated proofs are decomposed,
patched, and reverified [apollo_lean_collaboration_2025].

This project does not perform theorem proving, proof repair, or formal
mathematical verification. It borrows the architectural lesson: generated
research artifacts should be checked by deterministic tools with explicit error
surfaces. Here those tools are test suites, schema checks, evidence registries,
render validation, source hygiene greps, and review packets rather than Lean,
Isabelle, or Coq.

### ML For ML And Evolutionary Algorithm Discovery {#sec:ml-for-ml-evolutionary-discovery}

ML-for-ML systems optimize models, code, or algorithms with search loops that are
themselves subject to evaluation. Karpathy's `autoresearch` repository frames a
minimal version of this pattern as a prompt-controlled system with a fixed
budget, editable code surface, and comparable metric
[karpathy_autoresearch_2026]. MLAgentBench and MLE-bench package machine
learning tasks as scored, replayable environments with logs and grading outputs
[huang_mlagentbench_2023; chan_mle_bench_2024].

At a larger scale, AlphaEvolve couples language-model proposals to evolutionary
program search and automated evaluators, producing algorithmic improvements in
mathematics and computing [romera_paredes_alphaevolve_2025]. DeepEvolve adds
external retrieval, multi-file code editing, and debugging to the same basic
proposal-implementation-evaluation loop [deepevolve_2025]. This manuscript's
candidate search is intentionally smaller: a finite list of configured model
families is evaluated against `test_accuracy`, with deterministic selection
and recorded deferrals rather than unbounded code mutation.

### Agentic Science, Graph Retrieval, And Epistemic Foraging {#sec:agentic-science-graph-retrieval}

Agentic science surveys describe systems that move from tool use toward
scientific agency across perception, knowledge representation, planning,
experimentation, analysis, and communication [wei_agentic_science_2025; gridach_agentic_science_2025]. GraphRAG work adds structured retrieval to that
picture: graph construction and graph-aware retrieval can support multi-hop
reasoning, but benchmarks also show that knowledge-graph RAG remains brittle
when relevant knowledge is incomplete [graphrag_bench_2026; brink_kg_rag_2026]. Active-inference perspectives make a similar design demand
in different language: scientific agents need persistent uncertainty-aware
memory, causal models, counterfactual exploration, deterministic validation, and
human judgment as an architectural component [active_inference_science_2025].

This exemplar uses those ideas as constraints, not as capabilities it already
possesses. It does not run live literature mining, autonomous proof search,
external agent swarms, graph-based hypothesis hunting, or self-approval.
Instead it exposes bounded candidates, explicit budgets, local evidence links,
local `MNIST` input data, benchmark-style scoring, source-linked
figures, manuscript hydration, and human review gates. That is the intended
safe baseline for a public template.

### Benchmark, Documentation, And Process Analogies {#sec:benchmark-documentation-process-analogies}

`MNIST` and LeNet remain useful here because they provide a
compact historical benchmark for small neural networks and handwriting
recognition [lecun_gradient_1998; lecun_mnist_database]. Vision Transformers
introduce the patch-token pattern for image classification at scale
[dosovitskiy_vit_2020]; this exemplar borrows only the patching and attention
representation through `Tiny patch-attention classifier`, then keeps the
implementation inside the configured candidate budget. MLPerf Tiny and OpenML
motivate explicit task descriptions, fixed inputs, machine-readable run
metadata, and checkable metrics [banbury_mlperf_tiny_2021; vanschoren_openml_2014]. Machine-learning reproducibility checklists motivate
reporting data, seeds, model sizes, hyperparameters, and compute boundaries
[pineau_reproducibility_2020].

Dataset and model documentation work further informs the safe boundary.
Datasheets for Datasets motivate explicit reporting of dataset motivation,
composition, collection, and recommended use [gebru2021datasheets]. Model Cards
motivate structured reporting of model context, intended use, evaluation
procedure, and limitations [mitchell2019model_cards]. The diagnostic layer
follows the same conservative reporting posture: calibration is treated as
separate from accuracy [guo2017calibration], binomial accuracy intervals use
Wilson-style score intervals [wilson1927probable_inference], matched classifier
comparison is summarized through paired discordance
[dietterich1998statistical_tests], deterministic bootstrap intervals are local
resampling diagnostics [efron1993bootstrap], and probability quality is
reported with Brier score, negative log likelihood, and chance-corrected
agreement [brier1950verification; cohen1960coefficient].

The process language is borrowed cautiously from teleology and theoretical
biology. Kant's account of organized beings treats a natural purpose as a whole
whose parts and whole mutually condition one another
[ginsborg_kant_aesthetics_teleology]. Autopoiesis characterizes living systems
through self-producing organization [varela_autopoiesis_1974], and later work
connects Kantian natural purpose to autopoietic individuality
[weber_varela_life_after_kant_2002]. Moreno and Mossio's account of biological
autonomy emphasizes organizational closure and self-maintenance
[moreno_mossio_biological_autonomy_2015]. This paper uses those ideas only as
disciplined analogies for configured scientific workflows whose artifacts help
reproduce, constrain, and evaluate subsequent artifacts.

Security and supply-chain references enter with the same restraint. NIST's
zero-trust architecture treats verification as explicit and continuous rather
than inherited from a trusted perimeter [nist_sp800_207_zero_trust]. The NIST
Secure Software Development Framework emphasizes repeatable practices for
reducing software vulnerability risk [nist_sp800_218_ssdf]. SLSA frames
software-artifact provenance and supply-chain integrity as a graded assurance
problem [slsa_spec_latest], while MITRE ATT&CK T1195 names supply-chain
compromise as a concrete adversary technique [mitre_attack_t1195]. This
exemplar borrows those frameworks as disciplined analogies for local research
artifact integrity: checksums, inventories, review gates, and explicit
non-claims, not production deployment certification.

# Methodology {#sec:methodology}

The loop is implemented through the project source surface summarized by the
validated run artifacts. The project scripts remain thin dispatchers; reusable
behavior writes `output/data/autoresearch_loop.json`, `output/data/ml_task_results.json`,
`../figures/figure_registry.json`, `output/data/autoresearch_phase_ledger.json`, and
`output/data/manuscript_variable_provenance.json`.

## Task And Data {#sec:task-data}

The task is `small MNIST neural-network classification`. The default configuration loads
`data/mnist_small.npz`, with provenance in `data/mnist_small_provenance.json`, and uses
seed `20260525`. The subset contains `2000` training images
and `500` test images, with `10` classes present
in both splits and image shape `28 by 28`. The provenance artifact
records upstream source-file hashes, the subset seed, class counts, and the
compressed subset hash. The default pipeline never downloads data at runtime.
The train and test splits contain `200` and
`50` examples per class, respectively. The registered
class-balance diagnostic is @fig:mnist_class_balance, and the
dataset contact sheet is @fig:mnist_subset_contact_sheet.

The baseline is `nearest_centroid_baseline` (`nearest-centroid`). The bounded
candidate set is configured by the task artifact and covers
`MLP, nearest-centroid, softmax regression, tiny patch-attention`, including `Tiny patch-attention classifier` and at
least one deferred proposal. The transformer-style candidate borrows the
patch-token representation for comparison while staying inside the configured
iteration budget. This is intentionally a small configured model, not a claim
about full-scale image-transformer performance.

## Bounded Loop {#sec:bounded-loop}

The run follows `7` configured stages:

- Resolve the human-authored program, project topic, and research questions.
- Build an `AutoResearchPlan` from the domain profile, experiment plan, and
  pipeline DAG.
- Validate exact stage-gate names declared in `autoresearch.yaml`.
- Evaluate the configured `MNIST` candidate set up to the
  configured iteration budget.
- Generate claims only from configured questions and local artifact paths.
- Write data, reports, figures, benchmark scores, and review packets under the
  declared output contract.
- Run strict AutoResearch readiness validation and write readiness reports.

Candidates are declared in the proposal ledger and resolved from the task
configuration for execution. Each executable candidate declares a model type,
seed, training schedule, and model-specific parameters. The configured training
policy includes learning-rate decay `0.995` and gradient
clipping norm `5`, both recorded from the validated task
run rather than described as a free-form manuscript setting. The loop evaluates
at most `4` configured iterations, selects the highest
`test_accuracy`, and breaks ties by lower parameter count and identifier.
Candidates outside the budget are recorded as deferred; the run-derived status
summary is `accepted: 1, deferred: 1, rejected: 3`.

The closure is concrete and file-backed. `output/data/research_program.json`
constrains proposals; proposal records feed the bounded evaluation; evaluation
writes `output/data/ml_candidate_ledger.json` and `output/data/run_ledger.json`; ledgers support
artifact-linked claims; claims hydrate the manuscript through
`output/data/manuscript_variables.json`; readiness validation writes
`output/reports/autoresearch_readiness.json`; loop settlement is recorded in
`output/data/autoresearch_phase_ledger.json`; and review state is captured in
`output/data/review_decisions.json`. The loop therefore maintains an inspectable
research process around a small metric result without making the process
self-approving or opaque.

The concrete closure is intentionally close to research-object and workflow-run
provenance practice. The artifact manifest lists generated objects and checksums;
the figure registry binds captions to source artifacts; the variable provenance
sidecar records the source pointer for each injected token or table; and the
review packet keeps human decisions outside generated approval. This is a
minimal local analogue of machine-readable provenance rather than a claim of
full research-object packaging.

The generated schema manifest at `output/data/autoresearch_schema_manifest.json`
records `31` schema-versioned governance
payload(s) plus documented generic-table exemptions. The local research-object
manifest at `output/data/research_object_manifest.json` packages observed project paths,
hashes, the evidence registry, the source ledger, the schema manifest, and the
manual approval state. It is deliberately named a local research-object
manifest, not RO-Crate or SLSA compliance.

## Safety Controls {#sec:safety-controls}

The default autonomy level is `proposal_only`. The run ledger records
`0` LLM calls and USD `0.00` cost. The edit
allowlist is restricted to the public project source and manuscript surfaces,
plus the task configuration file, and the pipeline never executes
generated code. Review gates are emitted with deferred decisions so that
validation can confirm the gates exist without pretending that the machine
approved publication.

Publication approval is a non-generated input. The run may read
`human_review.yaml` and copy its state into review payloads, but generated
readiness cannot set publication approval by itself; the default local review
state remains `false`.

Disclosure: `AI-assisted AutoResearch` status is declared for this exemplar
because it models machine-produced plans, ledgers, reports, and manuscript
variables as review inputs rather than autonomous approval.

## Adversarial And Supply-Chain Controls {#sec:adversarial-supply-chain-controls}

The security layer is configured as `local_deterministic` with network
policy `default_offline`, integrity algorithm
`sha256`, external signing
`false`, and framework labels
`STRIDE, MITRE_ATT&CK_T1195`. Its scope is `Local research-artifact integrity evidence for this deterministic public exemplar`. These
values are generated from `output/data/autoresearch_security_profile.json`; the default
run remains offline and deterministic.

The local threat model covers `7` asset(s),
`7` threat row(s), and
`7` control row(s). The security artifacts are written
to `output/data/autoresearch_threat_model.json`,
`output/data/autoresearch_supply_chain_inventory.json`,
`output/data/autoresearch_integrity_attestation.json`, and
`output/reports/autoresearch_security_review.md`. The control-matrix figure is
@fig:autoresearch_security_control_matrix. The table and figure are generated from
the threat model and inventory, not manually maintained.

![Local security-control matrix from output/data/autoresearch_threat_model.json; controls map NIST, SLSA, and ATT&CK-inspired safeguards to deterministic evidence surfaces without claiming production security certification.

## Positioning Against Autonomous Science Systems {#sec:positioning-autonomous-science}

The implementation should be read as a bounded local analogue of current
AutoResearch trends, not as a miniature autonomous scientist. Artifact
manifests, evidence registries, review gates, and manuscript hydration provide
machine-readable governance surfaces for one offline project run. They do not
perform autonomous literature mining, proof search, live agent orchestration,
runtime dataset expansion, self-modifying code search, or self-approval of
publication claims.

## Evidence And Scoring {#sec:evidence-scoring}

The experiment writes `output/data/ml_task_results.json`, `output/data/ml_candidate_ledger.json`,
`output/data/ml_confusion_matrix.csv`, `output/data/ml_training_history.csv`,
`output/data/ml_error_examples.json`, `output/data/ml_prediction_records.json`,
`output/data/ml_classification_diagnostics.json`, `output/data/ml_candidate_intervals.json`,
`output/data/ml_class_balance.json`, `output/data/ml_calibration_report.json`,
`output/data/ml_calibration_bin_intervals.json`, `output/data/ml_robustness_report.json`,
`output/data/ml_probability_diagnostics.json`, `output/data/ml_bootstrap_intervals.json`,
`output/data/ml_paired_comparison.json`, `output/data/ml_candidate_rank_stability.json`,
`output/data/ml_statistical_summary.json`, `output/data/ml_training_diagnostics.json`,
`output/reports/ml_benchmark_score.json`, `output/data/benchmark_boundary.json`,
`output/data/figure_quality_report.json`, and
registered figures through
`../figures/figure_registry.json`. The diagnostic payloads preserve probabilities,
confidence and margin summaries, class metrics, calibration bins,
confusion-pair summaries, train/test gaps, deterministic no-retrain
perturbation scores, bootstrap intervals, paired baseline comparison,
rank-stability frequencies, calibration-bin Wilson intervals, selective
accuracy thresholds, Brier score, negative log likelihood, top-2 accuracy,
probability-quality comparisons, learning-rate traces, best-epoch markers,
final learning rates, and train-test gap summaries without serializing model
weights. The benchmark score combines metric
improvement, budget compliance, offline execution, transformer-candidate
coverage, and candidate-selection status. The benchmark-boundary artifact
records fixture scope, metric direction, candidate families, budget,
statistical-method artifacts, and explicit non-claims, so benchmark-adjacent
statistics remain local readiness diagnostics rather than broad empirical or
publication claims. Manuscript variables are hydrated from these artifacts, and
readiness validation checks `output/reports/evidence_registry.json`,
`output/reports/artifact_manifest.json`, method ledgers, review gates, benchmark outputs,
the phase ledger, figure-quality report, and AI-assisted disclosure before
rendering is treated as ready for review. The reviewer-facing
`output/data/autoresearch_evidence_overview.json` then summarizes readiness versus
publication approval, claim-evidence rows, source-ledger status, benchmark
boundary issues, and security/integrity status without granting approval.
The generated tables and figure blocks used in @sec:results are sourced through
`output/data/manuscript_variable_provenance.json` and `output/data/manuscript_figure_blocks.json`, so captions,
artifact tables, and run-derived result statements share the same validated
artifact base.

The figure registry also carries the method contract for each visualization:
source artifact, generated file, rendering method, and claim boundary. The
rendered method table below is generated from that registry rather than
maintained manually.

# Results {#sec:results}

## Candidate Outcome {#sec:candidate-outcome}

The generated loop selected `exp-mlp-tanh-64`
(`One-hidden-layer tanh MLP`, `MLP`) after evaluating
`4` candidate(s) from a proposed set of
`5`. The `nearest_centroid_baseline`
(`nearest-centroid`) baseline reached `82.6%`
`test_accuracy`, while the selected candidate reached `89.4%`, an
absolute change of `6.8%`. The selected model has
`50890` parameters. The transformer-candidate evaluated
flag is `true`, and the candidate budget exhausted flag is
`true`, which means the ledger records
`1` deferred proposal(s) rather than expanding the run
automatically.

The benchmark score is `1`. That score is not a model-quality
claim by itself; it is a compact grading artifact for the methods contract:
metric improvement, budget compliance, offline execution, and selected-candidate
recording. Rank-stability diagnostics report that the selected candidate is top
ranked in `72.5%` of deterministic bootstrap
resamples, with runner-up `exp-mlp-relu-32`. The candidate
score figure is registered as
@fig:ml_candidate_scores, the confusion matrix as
@fig:ml_confusion_matrix, the per-class diagnostic as
@fig:ml_per_class_accuracy, the learning curves as

## Diagnostic Analysis {#sec:diagnostic-analysis}

The selected candidate macro F1 is `89.4%`, with a held-out
accuracy interval of `86.4% to 91.8%`. Probability diagnostics
report expected calibration error `2.9%` and
`11` high-confidence error(s). The top
non-diagonal confusion pair is `4 -> 9 (4)`, and the minimum
selected-candidate accuracy across deterministic robustness transforms is
`80.0%`. These values are descriptive diagnostics for the
validated local run, not external benchmark claims.

### Classification And Error Structure {#sec:classification-error-structure}

The class-level and error-pattern diagnostics are intentionally visual-first:
@fig:ml_calibration_reliability checks confidence calibration,
@fig:ml_classification_metrics_heatmap separates precision, recall, and F1 by
digit, and @fig:ml_confusion_pairs ranks the non-diagonal confusions
that most shape the selected-candidate error profile. The accompanying tables
preserve the same values for audit and downstream comparison.

Additional uncertainty and matched-comparison diagnostics report bootstrap

`6.8%`, exact McNemar p-value `0.000`, mean
correct-prediction confidence `90.9%`, mean error
confidence `63.1%`, and `22` low-margin
selected-candidate prediction(s). These diagnostics are generated from the
fixed local test split and are reported as run evidence, not as population-level
certification.

### Probability Quality And Selective Prediction {#sec:probability-quality-selective-prediction}

Probability-quality diagnostics report Brier score `0.161`,
negative log likelihood `0.361`, top-2 accuracy
`95.6%`, and Cohen kappa `0.882` for the
selected candidate. At the highest configured confidence threshold, retained
coverage is `67.8%` and selective accuracy is
`98.2%`.

The selective-prediction view in @fig:ml_selective_accuracy reports the
configured confidence-threshold trade-off: retaining fewer predictions can raise
selective accuracy, but the coverage table keeps that trade-off explicit. The
candidate probability-quality comparison in @fig:ml_probability_quality
keeps accuracy separate from proper-score behavior, so the selected candidate is
not treated as automatically best on every diagnostic axis.

The candidate-selection audit separates the objective ranking from descriptive
diagnostics. It records the configured metric, Wilson interval, probability
quality, parameter count, and deterministic tie-break context for each
evaluated candidate. The diagnostic-boundary table states what each generated
surface supports and what it does not support.

## Readiness And Review Artifacts {#sec:readiness-review-artifacts}

The broader AutoResearch run writes the reproducibility, benchmark, review, and
manuscript-hydration surfaces summarized below. The schema manifest records
`31` schema-versioned governance payload(s), and
the local research-object manifest records `84`
observed artifact record(s) with checksums and approval state
`false`. The phase ledger records
`3` settlement pass(es), while the
figure-quality report covers `25` registered
figure(s) with validity `false`.

## Security Readiness And Integrity Evidence {#sec:security-readiness-integrity}

The local security profile reports attestation status
`passed` after checking
`80` file record(s), with
`0` missing record(s) and
`0` checksum mismatch(es). The inventory
contains `14` input record(s) and
`69` generated-artifact record(s). The
integrity-chain figure is @fig:autoresearch_integrity_chain. These values support
local artifact-integrity claims only; they do not claim external signing,
production SLSA compliance, or runtime security monitoring.

![Local integrity chain from output/data/autoresearch_integrity_attestation.json; checksums summarize the observed run artifacts and remain unsigned local evidence.

## Manuscript Hydration Provenance {#sec:manuscript-hydration-provenance}

The final run supports `6` manuscript-facing claim(s)
and checks `78` required artifact(s). The rendered
manuscript uses injected variables from generated data payloads, so the abstract
and results track the latest analysis run rather than hard-coded counts. The
final readiness status is `passed`; generated review decisions are
recorded as deferred for human review rather than as self-approval.

# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

`template_autoresearch_project` shows how a tractable AutoResearch task can be represented as
reproducible template infrastructure. The `small MNIST neural-network classification` experiment is small
by design, but it exercises the method surfaces that matter for a public
default: a declared research program, local input-data provenance, bounded
candidate families (`MLP, nearest-centroid, softmax regression, tiny patch-attention`), objective scoring, budget and
cost ledgers, evidence-linked claims, generated figures, benchmark grading,
manuscript-variable hydration, loop-settlement ledgers, figure-quality checks,
validation, local integrity attestation (`passed`),
and human review gates.

The broader field is converging across five related trends. Autoresearch systems
seek end-to-end automation of ideation, experiment execution, writing, and
review. Autoformalization pushes informal claims toward machine-checkable
representations. ML-for-ML systems use search, evaluation, and evolutionary code
loops to improve algorithms. Agentic science composes retrieval, planning,
experimentation, and communication into higher-autonomy workflows. Structured
knowledge synthesis supplies the substrate that all of those systems need:
source-linked artifacts, knowledge graphs, tensors, vector spaces, and
uncertainty-aware memories that can be navigated without losing provenance.

This exemplar makes a deliberately narrower contribution. It does not mine the
live literature, construct a Conceptual Nexus Model, search for Lean proofs,
mutate arbitrary code, coordinate external agents, or approve its own paper.
Instead it demonstrates governance infrastructure for automated research
workflows: every important claim is hydrated from run artifacts, every generated
figure is registry-bound and locally checked for source and pixel integrity,
every budget and candidate decision is recorded, and review state remains
outside generated self-approval. The security layer adds local inventory and
checksum evidence while keeping external signing and production deployment
claims out of scope.

The durable product is therefore not only the `MNIST` metric.
It is a reproducible research process whose data, claims, captions, figures,
review gates, and manuscript variables can be reviewed, rerun, and extended. As
more ambitious automated-science systems mature, this kind of offline,
deterministic, evidence-governed baseline remains useful because it preserves the
part of scientific automation that should not be optional: inspectable
provenance, explicit limits, and human-governed publication judgment.
